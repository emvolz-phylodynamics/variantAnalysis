  * **`r as.character(num_sequences)` whole genomes** sampled from COGUK overall

We conduct variant scanning in real-time on lineages or variants of interest to identify potential clusters or variants of concern. We identify clusters with a minimum of **`r as.character(min_size)`** genome sequences and a maximum size of **`r as.character(max_size)`** genome sequences. We use a generalised linear (GLM) model to compare growth rates between clusters of interest. To do this, we select a cluster of interest and select a matched control sample of sequences based on sampling time, admin2, and prevalence over time. We run a GLM to calculate the log odds of a sample being from our cluster of interest vs. our control sample over time. We multiply this by generation time to calculate a relative growth rate per generation for each cluster of interest, using a mean generation time of **`r generation_time`** days.

Table 1 and Figure 1 present some summary data of the sequence data and logistic growth rate analyses for the clusters of interest. We use a logsitic growth rate cut-off of **`r log_growth_rate_cut_off`** to exclude clusters which show an equivalent or reduced growth rate compared to matched control samples from the general population prior to applying inclusion criteria, selecting only clusters with `r inclusion_criteria`. We identify **`r n_clusters`** clusters with a growth rate > **`r log_growth_rate_cut_off`**, with growth rates ranging from **`r log_growth_rate_cut_off`** to **`r max_growth_rate_Ygr1`**. Following the application of inclusion criteria to outputs, we identify **`r n_clusters_included`** clusters with growth rates rangiing from **`r log_growth_rate_cut_off`** to **`r max_growth_rate_Ygr2`** for our `r cluster_interest` of interest. Defining mutations are identified as mutations that are present in > **`r defining_mutations_cut_off`****%** of sequences within a given cluster of interest and are not present in > **`r defining_mutations_cut_off`****%** of sequences in a matched sample from the general population.

Cluster defining mutations exclude synSNPs, as these are unlikely to be driving higher growth rates, although they are observed in the original analyses and outputs. A figure (Figure 7) with proportions of sequences with defining mutations by cluster is included further in the report.

Figure 3 and 4 shows the coordinates and logistic growth rates of samples per **cluster** by location in the UK, using longitude and latitude data linked to COGUK sequence data. **`r NA_sequences`** were excluded from regional plots due to missing data on longitude, latitude or outer postcode. Figure 5 shows the sample time ditribution for sequences from clusters of interest. Only the  genomes sequences from the clusters of interest are plotted on the maps.

We compare the present growth rates to those from previous runs to identify changes occuring over time in lineages of interest. We select the clusters for `r cluster_interest` of interest with the highest growth rates across all variant scanner runs to identify potential clusters or variants of interest. Figure 6 shows the clusters identified for `r cluster_interest`.

Only clusters which contain >50% of lineages of interest are selected for comparison. Shape represents minimum clade size chosen for scanner runs (min = {10,25}). * 

\newpage

We report the proportion of sequences (**>`r prop_mutations` %**) per clusters with mutations of interest present. We exclude synSNPs, as these are unlikely to be driving higher growth rates. These figures include all mutations present within clusters of interest, unlike Table 1 which includes only mutations present in > **`r defining_mutations_cut_off`****%** of sequences within a cluster of interest and not present in > **`r defining_mutations_cut_off`****%** of sequences in the matched sample sequences.
