We conduct variant scanning in real-time on lineages or variants of interest to identify potential clusters or variants of concern. We identify clusters with a minimum of **`r as.character(min_size)`** genome sequences and a maximum size of **`r as.character(max_size)`** genome sequences. We use a generalised linear (GLM) model to compare growth rates between clusters of interest. To do this, we select a cluster of interest and select a matched control sample of sequences based on sampling time, admin2, and prevalence over time. We run a GLM to calculate the log odds of a sample being from our cluster of interest vs. our control sample over time. We multiply this by generation time to calculate a relative growth rate per generation for each cluster of interest, using a mean generation time of **`r generation_time`** days.

Table 1 and Figure 1 present some summary data of the sequence data and logistic growth rate analyses for the clusters of interest. We use a logsitic growth rate cut-off of **`r log_growth_rate_cut_off`** to exclude clusters which show an equivalent or reduced growth rate compared to matched control samples from the general population prior to applying inclusion criteria, selecting only clusters with `r inclusion_criteria`. We identify **`r n_clusters`** clusters with a growth rate > **`r log_growth_rate_cut_off`**, with growth rates ranging from **`r log_growth_rate_cut_off`** to **`r max_growth_rate`**. Following the application of inclusion criteria to outputs, we identify **`r n_clusters_included`** cluster with growth rates equal to **`r max_growth_rate2`** for our `r cluster_interest` of interest. Defining mutations are identified as mutations that are present in >= **`r defining_mutations_cut_off`****%** of sequences within a given cluster of interest and are not present in >= **`r defining_mutations_cut_off`****%** of sequences in a matched sample from the general population.

Cluster defining mutations exclude synSNPs, as these are unlikely to be driving higher growth rates, although they are observed in the original analyses and outputs. A figure (Figure 7) with proportions of sequences with defining mutations by cluster is included further in the report. Mutation status is measured as defining (>90% of sequences in cluster of interest and not >90% of sequences in cluster of comparison sample), present or absent.

Figure 2 shows the frequency of log odds over time of our clusters of interest compared to a matched sample from the general population using a generalised additive model (GAM). We match clusters of interest to comaparison samples based on adm2 and sample time, using weights derived from PHE metadata.

Figure 3 and 4 shows the coordinates and logistic growth rates of samples per **cluster** by location in the UK, using longitude and latitude data linked to COGUK sequence data. **29 sequences** were excluded from regional plots due to missing data on longitude, latitude or outer postcode.

We compare the present growth rates to those from previous runs to identify changes occuring over time in lineages or mutations of interest. We select the clusters for `r cluster_interest` of interest with the highest growth rates across all variant scanner runs to identify potential clusters or variants of interest. Figure 6 shows the clusters identified for `r cluster_interest`.

We report the proportion of sequences (**>`r prop_mutations` %**) per clusters with mutations of interest present. We exclude synSNPs, as these are unlikely to be driving higher growth rates.
